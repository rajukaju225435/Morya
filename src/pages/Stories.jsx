      title: "Birth of Lord Ganesha",
      shortDescription: "The divine story of how Lord Ganesha came into being",
      fullStory: `One day, Goddess Parvati created a boy from the turmeric paste she used for bathing. She breathed life into him and asked him to guard the door while she bathed. When Lord Shiva returned and tried to enter, the boy refused to let him pass. This led to a fierce battle where Shiva, in his anger, severed the boy's head. 

      Upon learning the truth from Parvati, Shiva was filled with remorse. He sent his followers to bring the head of the first living being they found facing north. They returned with an elephant's head, which Shiva placed on the boy's body, bringing him back to life. He blessed him as Ganesha, the lord of all beings, and declared that he would be worshipped first in all ceremonies.`,

      title: "Ganesha and Kartikeya",
      shortDescription: "The race around the universe",
      fullStory: `Once, Lord Shiva and Parvati decided to test their two sons. They announced that whoever could circle the entire universe first would receive a divine fruit of knowledge. Kartikeya immediately mounted his peacock and flew off to circle the universe.

      Ganesha, with his wisdom, simply walked around his parents and said, "You are my universe. Where else do I need to go?" Touched by his devotion and intelligence, Shiva and Parvati declared Ganesha the winner. This story shows that wisdom and devotion are greater than physical strength.`,

      title: "Ganesha and the Moon",
      shortDescription: "Why we don't look at the moon on Ganesh Chaturthi",
      fullStory: `On a Ganesh Chaturthi night, after feasting on modaks, Ganesha was riding his mouse when he stumbled and fell. The moon saw this and laughed at him. Angry at being mocked, Ganesha cursed the moon that anyone who looked at it on Ganesh Chaturthi would face false accusations.

      The moon begged for forgiveness, and Ganesha modified the curse, saying that those who hear this story would be freed from the curse. This is why people avoid looking at the moon on Ganesh Chaturthi and share this tale.`,

      fullStory: `When sage Vyasa needed someone to write down the Mahabharata as he recited it, he approached Ganesha. Ganesha agreed on the condition that Vyasa would narrate without pause. Vyasa agreed, but asked that Ganesha must understand everything before writing.

      During the dictation, Ganesha's pen broke. Not wanting to stop the flow, he broke off his own tusk and used it as a pen to continue writing. This sacrifice earned him the name Ekadanta (one-tusked).`,

      fullStory: `A poor woman named Sudama had nothing but a handful of rice. With great devotion, she made kheer (sweet rice pudding) for Ganesha. Meanwhile, a wealthy merchant offered elaborate dishes to Ganesha.

      Ganesha appeared in the woman's humble hut first, enjoying her simple kheer made with love. When asked why he chose her offering over the merchant's feast, Ganesha replied, "It's not the offering but the devotion behind it that matters."`,

      fullStory: `Kubera, the god of wealth, once invited Ganesha to dinner to show off his riches. Young Ganesha arrived and began eating everything in sight. No matter how much food was served, Ganesha's appetite seemed endless.

      Soon, Kubera's entire treasury was exhausted, yet Ganesha was still hungry. In desperation, Kubera ran to Shiva for help. Shiva gave him a handful of roasted rice and told him to offer it with humility. When Kubera did so, Ganesha was satisfied immediately, teaching that humility is more valuable than pride in wealth.`,
